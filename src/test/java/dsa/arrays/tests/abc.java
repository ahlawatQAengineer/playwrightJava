    //Here are 5 important DSA problems relevant for a Senior QA, focusing on arrays and collections (no trees or graphs):
    //
    //1. **Find the First Non-Repeated Character in a String**
    //   - Given a string, find the first character that does not repeat anywhere in the string.
    //    - And then print all the unique repeating elements
    //
    //
    //2. **Remove Duplicates from an Array/List**
    //   - Given an array or list, remove all duplicate elements and return the result.
    //
    //3. **Find the Intersection of Two Arrays/Lists**
    //   - Given two arrays or lists, return a new array containing only the elements that are present in both.
    //
    //4. **Find the Maximum Occurring Element in an Array/List**
    //   - Given an array or list, find the element that appears the most number of times.
    //
    //5. **Reverse a Collection (Array/List) In-Place**
    //   - Reverse the elements of an array or list without using extra space.
    //
    //These problems test understanding of Java collections, arrays, and basic algorithmic thinkingâ€”skills important for a Senior QA.
